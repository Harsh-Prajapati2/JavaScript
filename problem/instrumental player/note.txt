You have an HTML file and CSS code that represents a Drumkit Player. 
The HTML file contains buttons representing different drum sounds, 
and the CSS code styles the elements. Your task is to complete the JavaScript code to make it a working drumkit player.

Objective:
Add a keypress event listener to all the buttons in the HTML file.
When a specific key corresponding to a button is pressed, the corresponding sound should be played.
Each button should also have a click event listener that triggers the same function as the keypress event.
The following keys and their corresponding sound URLs should be used:
1- Key 'w': Sound URL - Sound1
2- Key 'a': Sound URL - Sound2
3- Key 's': Sound URL - Sound3
4- Key 'd': Sound URL - Sound4
5- Key 'j': Sound URL - Sound5
6- Key 'k': Sound URL - Sound6
7- Key 'l': Sound URL - Sound7

Note:
You should use the Audio tag to play the sound files.
