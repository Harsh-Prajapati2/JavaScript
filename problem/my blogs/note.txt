Problem statement
You are tasked with creating a webpage that displays a list of blog posts. 
Each blog post will include a title, a date, and content. 
Your goal is to use JavaScript to dynamically generate and display blog posts on the page based on data 
provided in an array.

Objective:
Write a function called addBlog that performs the following:

Accept Input:
The function should take one parameter, blog, which is an object with the following properties:
title: A string representing the title of the blog post.
date: A string representing the date of the blog post.
content: A string representing the content of the blog post.


Create HTML Structure:
Create a new div element with the class blog-post.
Create a div element with the class blog-header.
Create an h2 element with the class blog-title and set its text to the title property of the blog object.
Create a p element with the class blog-date and set its text to the date property of the blog object.
Create a p element with the class blog-content and set its text to the content property of the blog object.


Append Elements:
Append the h2 (blog title) and p (blog date) elements to the div with the class blog-header.
Append the div with the class blog-header to the div with the class blog-post.
Append the p (blog content) to the div with the class blog-post.
Append the entire div with the class blog-post to the ul element with the class blog-list.


Iterate through Data:
Call the addBlog function for each object in an array of blog data to populate the page(already called in the js file).


Expected Output:
The visual representation of the structure is as follows:
Note:
1. The function should be called for each blog post in an array of blog data. 
2. The list of blog posts should be contained within an `ul` element with the class `blog-list`.

Hint:
Use classList.add() method and className property to add a class to an HTML element.
